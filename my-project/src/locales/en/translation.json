It allows copying the entire or a portion of data packets from a network port or a group of ports and forwarding them to a designated port for DPI to receive these packets.",
    "content2": "Using Network TAPs: Network TAPs (Terminal Access Points) are physical devices plugged in between network connections to copy packets and forward them to DPI. Network TAPs provide a space and time access point for monitoring and analyzing network packets.",
    "content3": "Integration with Firewall or Router: DPI can be directly integrated into devices such as firewalls or routers. In this case, these devices will be responsible for routing network packets through DPI before they continue to be forwarded to the final destination.",
    "content4": "Using Agent or Software Sensor: DPI can be deployed by installing agents or software sensors directly on servers or network devices. This agent acts as an interface between network packets and DPI, allowing DPI to receive and analyze packets from various sources.",
    "content5": "Inspecting Header Information: DPI examines the header information of the network packet to gain an overview of the packet's source and destination. This information includes source address, destination address, source port, destination port, protocol in use, and other fields in the packet header. This header information provides initial indications of the type of service or application the packet is using.",
    "content6": "Determining Protocols: Based on the header information, DPI determines the network protocol used in the packet, such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, and other protocols. By determining the protocol, DPI can understand how the packet is encapsulated and transmitted across the network.",
    "content7": "Analyzing Other Fields and Values: DPI also examines other fields and values in the network packet to gather additional detailed information. These fields may include option fields, data fields, checksum fields, and other fields depending on the specific protocol and packet format.",
    "content8": "Identifying Encryption Method: Before DPI can decode the packet, it needs to identify the encryption method used. The packet may be encrypted using methods like SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) or other open-source encryption. DPI uses algorithms and pattern recognition to determine the encryption method and prepares for decryption.",
    "content9": "Decoding the Packet: After identifying the encryption method, DPI uses the corresponding algorithms to decode the packet. This process ensures that the data within the packet is returned to its original form, displaying the actual content of the packet. For example, if the packet is encrypted using SSL/TLS, DPI will use the encryption keys and algorithms to decrypt and retrieve the original data in the packet.",
    "content10": "Reassembling Segments: If the original packet has been fragmented into segments for transmission over the network, DPI performs the reassembly of these segments into complete packets. This process involves identifying and arranging the segments in order and concatenating them to form a complete packet.",
    "content11": "Checking Data Structure: DPI examines the data structure inside the packet, including fields, elements, and other data structures. This helps DPI understand how information is organized and transmitted within the packet.",
    "content12": "Analysis of Attributes and Information: DPI identifies important attributes and information within the content of the packet. This may include IP addresses, MAC addresses, connection ports, message headers, payload data, and other information related to the protocol and application used in the packet.",
    "content13": "Pattern and Signature Identification: DPI compares the content of the packet with a set of known patterns and signatures of threats, attacks, or other suspicious behaviors. These patterns and signatures may include special character strings, malware, malicious domain names, known attack forms, and other intrusion patterns. If DPI finds matches within the content, it can determine that the packet contains attack patterns or is performing suspicious behavior.",
    "content14": "Application of Rules and Policies: DPI can apply predefined rules and policies to identify legitimate and illegitimate behavior. These rules and policies can be based on character strings, regular expressions, behavioral models, or other criteria to identify behavior patterns and unwanted behaviors.",
    "content15": "Classification and Alerting: Based on the analysis results, DPI classifies the packet into different groups or types of behavior and provides corresponding alerts.",
    "content16": "Communication Blocking: DPI has the ability to block the communication of a packet or a data stream if it is determined to contain attack patterns, malware, or violations of network security policies. When a packet is blocked, it can be denied or redirected to an undesired destination.",
    "content17": "Logging and Monitoring: DPI can record information about network activities and store them in logs for analysis and future reference. This helps identify patterns of intrusive, attacking, or unwanted behaviors and supports the investigation and analysis process in the future.",
